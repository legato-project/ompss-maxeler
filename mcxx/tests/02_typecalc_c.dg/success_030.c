// Comment
// We used to define the type of wchar_t using this typedef.
// The problem is that the definition of wchar_t is compiler-specific, so we
// cannot assume that our internal type for wide string literals is the same as
// the backend compiler.
//
// typedef __typeof__(*(L"")) wchar_t;

char c[256] = "hello";
wchar_t c1[256] = L"hello";
